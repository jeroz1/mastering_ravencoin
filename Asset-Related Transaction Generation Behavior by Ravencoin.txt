Asset-Related Transaction Generation Behavior by Ravencoin
==========================================================


Creating Assets:
----------------
	1 input: 	0) the source of the 500 RVN to burn
	4 outputs: 	0) the 500 RVN burn, with transaction output "value" set to 500
				1) the RVN change to a change address, with transaction output "value" set as needed
				2) a "type 6f=o owner" creation of the asset owner token with "value"=0 and no encoded qty or features (OP_DROP comes right after the asset name with appended "!")
					sent to a new address
				3) a "type 71 new" asset issue order with "value"=0 and qty and other attributes encoded as desired and sent to the same address used for output#2


Creating SubAssets:
-------------------
	2 inputs: 	0) the source of the 100 RVN to burn
				1) the asset owner token
	5 outputs:	0) The RVN change to a change address with "value" set as needed
				1) the 100 RVN burn with "value" set at 100
				2) a "type 74=t transfer" of the master owner token to the change address used for output#0 with encoded qty=1 and "value"=0
				3) a "type 6f=o owner" creation of the subasset owner token with "value"=0 and no encoded qty or features (OP_DROP comes right after the subasset name w appended "!")
					sent to a new address
				4) a "type 71=q new" subasset issue order with "value"=0 and qty and other attributes encoded as desired and sent to the same address used for output#3 

Creating Unique Assets:
-----------------------
	2 inputs:	0) the source of the 5 RVN to burn
				1) the asset owner token
	4 outputs:	0) the 5 RVN burn with "value" set at 5
				1) a "type 74=t transfer" of the master owner token to the change address used for output#2 with encoded qty=1 and "value"=0
				2) The RVN change to a change address with "value" set as needed, 
				3) a "type 71=q new" asset issue order with "value"=0 and with encoded qty=1, other attributes encoded as desired, and sent to a new address
				-note that no owner token is generated for the unique asset


Transferring Owner Assets:
--------------------------
	2 inputs:	0) the source of RVN for the transaction fees
				1) the asset owner token 

	2 output:	0) a "type 74=t transfer" of the master owner token to the new address with encoded qty=1 and "value"=0
				1) the RVN change to a change address, with "value" set as needed

Transferring non-Owner Assets:
------------------------------
	2 inputs:	0) the source of RVN for the transaction fees
				1) the non-owner asset token(s)
	
	3 outputs:	0) a "type 74=t transfer" of the assets being sent to new address, with "value"=0, and qty and other attributes encoded as desired.
				1) a "type 74=t transfer" of the remaining assets being sent to a change address, with "value"=0, and qty and other attributes encoded as desired.
				2) The RVN change to the same change address used for output#1, with transaction output "value" set as needed

Reissuing an Asset:
-------------------
	2 inputs:

	4 outputs:
