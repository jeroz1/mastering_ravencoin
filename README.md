# Mastering Ravencoin

An (eventually) book-like collection of information about Ravencoin for developers

The information here will make no attempt to replace or compete with the famous and wonderful book "Mastering Bitcoin" by Andreas Antonopoulos

The goal here is to provide additional information documenting how Ravencoin differs from bitcoin and extends bitcoin.
